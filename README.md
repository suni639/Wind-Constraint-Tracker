# ⚡ UK Wind Constraint Tracker: The Storm Jocelyn Case Study

> **A data-driven analysis of the UK's "Billion Pound Problem": Quantifying the gap between green energy generation and national grid infrastructure.**

---

## 📖 Executive Summary
On **January 24, 2024 (Storm Jocelyn)**, the UK experienced 80mph winds. While the nation's wind farms were capable of powering millions of homes with cheap, renewable energy, the physical grid hit a wall. This project uses real-time telemetry from the **Elexon Insights API** to quantify the energy discarded during this event and the resulting financial burden placed on UK consumers.

## 📉 Energy & Curtailment 101: The Paradox

### The "Traffic Jam" for Electrons
In a perfect world, every kilowatt of green energy generated by a wind turbine reaches the consumer. In reality, the UK grid is constrained by its physical "pipes" (pylons and subsea cables).

* **The Constraint:** When cables—specifically the **B6 Boundary** between Scotland and England—hit their thermal limits, they cannot carry more power.
* **The Action (Curtailment):** To prevent the cables from melting and to maintain a stable grid frequency of **50Hz**, the Grid Operator (NESO) pays wind farms to turn **OFF**.
* **The Replacement:** Because demand in the South (London, etc.) remains high, NESO must pay gas-fired power stations in the South to turn **ON** to fill the gap.
* **The Cost:** Consumers pay for both. These "constraint payments" exceeded **£1 Billion** by October 2025. [Source: Carbon Tracker](https://carbontracker.org/britain-wastes-enough-wind-generation-to-power-1-million-homes/)

## 🌪️ The Case Study: Storm Jocelyn
During the 24-hour period of Storm Jocelyn, the North of the UK was a green energy powerhouse, yet the grid was forced into massive interventions.

* **Total Energy Discarded:** ~135,000 MWh
* **Estimated Intervention Cost:** ~£12 Million
* **Consumer Impact:** Enough clean energy to power roughly **12,000 homes for a full year** was lost in just 24 hours.

## 🧪 Technical Methodology
The steps below detail how raw electrical telemetry was converted into economic insights.

### 1. Data Ingestion (Elexon BMRS API)
A Python pipeline was developed to query the **Elexon Insights API**. 
* **Target Data:** Bid-Offer Acceptances (BOAs)—the literal instructions sent by the grid to generators.
* **Logic:** Because the API limits data to single 30-minute chunks, a loop was used to reconstruct the full 24-hour picture across all 48 settlement periods.

### 2. Identity Resolution (NESO Register)
Raw grid data uses cryptic codes (e.g., `T_HOWAO-1`). The **NESO BM Unit Register** was used to map these codes to their physical fuel type, allowing us to isolate **WIND** assets and filter out gas or nuclear data.

### 3. Physics-to-Finance (The Math)
Power is measured in **Megawatts (MW)**, but we pay for **Megawatt-hours (MWh)**. Applying **Trapezoidal Rule** to calculate the volume (a fancy term you probably learned in school to work out the area under a curve):
$$\text{Volume (MWh)} = \frac{\text{LevelFrom} + \text{LevelTo}}{2} \times \text{Duration (Hours)}$$

### 4. Valuation Assumption (£70/MWh)
A flat rate of **£70/MWh** was applied to the wasted volume. This represents the **Opportunity Cost**:
* **Subsidy Loss:** Wind farms lose ~£55/MWh in government subsidies (ROCs/CfDs) when they stop.
* **Market Loss:** ~£15/MWh in lost wholesale revenue.
* **Total:** £70/MWh is the minimum compensation required to make the wind farm "financially whole."

## 🏗️ Strategic Implications: Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP)
This project serves as visual evidence for the move toward **Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP)**. 
Currently, the UK has a single national price. Under LMP, prices in Scotland would go negative during storms, which should incentivize energy-intensive industries (e.g. Data Centers, Hydrogen) to move North and use the "trapped" energy rather than paying to throw it away.

## ⚠️ Limitations & Future Work
* **Conservative Modeling:** The £12M figure ignores the cost of the **Gas** plants started in the South to replace the wind. The true cost to the consumer is likely double.
* **FPN Baseline:** Future iterations could incorporate **Final Physical Notifications (FPNs)** to see exactly what the wind farm planned to generate versus what it was allowed to.
* **Live Pricing:** To get a more accurate pricing mechanism, the £70/MWh heuristic could be replaced with real-time Balancing Mechanism "Cashout Prices."
